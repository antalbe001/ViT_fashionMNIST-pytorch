# Visualizing ViT attention maps of FashionMNIST dataset

ViT implementation for image classification of FashionMNIST dataset from scatch.
In _mean_min_max.ipynb_ the attention maps are displayed first by averaging the attention maps for each head, then considering first the minimum and then the maximum. _each_head_visualization.ipynb_ shows attention maps for each attention head. _rollout.ipynb_ uses visualization method as introduced in _https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00928_. For each file there is a version in which random transformations are applied to the dataset
